## About
It's an expo mobile app that I made for a vacancy, in it, I used the star wars api ( [SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/) ) to fetch data and redux to persist it. I learned some
animations from the animated library, with it, I made a loading animation to honor the game Star Wars Battlefront II and other cool things like an 
animated scroll. I made it all in 2 weeks, I hope you like it and don't forget to give this repo a star.
